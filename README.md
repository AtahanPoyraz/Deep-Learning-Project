# Image Classification and Generation Projects

This repository contains several deep learning projects implemented using various neural network architectures. These projects include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Cat vs. Dog Image Classification (CNN)**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using Keras and TensorFlow. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle.

- **Goal**: Train a CNN to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs.
- **Tech**: Keras, TensorFlow
- **Model Architecture**: Includes Convolutional Layers, Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Fully Connected Layers for binary classification.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the projects:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**
